Simple drag and drop puzzle game

Main goal was to use native html5 drag and drop feature, without usage of any JavaScript framework.

What is missing:
- message that puzzle is finnished
- better puzzle borders view
- better layout

Instalation:
You need to have Node.js version more or equal 10.0.0 installed

In console:

npm install
